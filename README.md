# 01-Guessing
The first project for my C220 class.
It is a simple game where the user guesses a number. The number is between 1 and 100. The overcofident computer will be sure to let you know how many tries it took you. If you take too many it won't be impressed!
The purpose of this project was to teach us about data types and variables.
